# Mo examples
This is a repo of code to get a feel for the planned syntax and to test around with the compiler.
Most of the snippets can already be parsed into an AST. You can try it out by using the moc-cli binary: 

``mo --path <path_to_file> --print-ast``

## Ideas folder
The /ideas folder is more of a playground. Many of the contained files cannot be parsed yet.
As the compiler is developed more, the vision for the syntax and grammar will become clearer and clearer.
